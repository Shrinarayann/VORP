## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
VORP follows a client-server model:
- **Client:** React-based SPA with responsive design and interactive maps.
- **Server:** Flask API managing optimization requests and data handling.
- **Algorithms:** Google OR-Tools for solving complex routing scenarios.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Server Setup
```bash
cd VORP/server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```
Server runs at: `http://localhost:8080`

### Client Setup
```bash
cd VORP/client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Client runs at: `http://localhost:5173`

## ‚ö° How It Works
1. **Input Data:** Add delivery locations, demands, and vehicle fleet details.
2. **Set Constraints:** Choose a depot and configure vehicle specifications.
3. **Optimize Routes:** The system calculates efficient routes using OR-Tools.
4. **Visualize Results:** Display routes and metrics on the interactive map.
5. **Save & Share:** Store optimized routes for future reference or team collaboration.
